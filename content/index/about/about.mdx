I'm a Blockchain and Frontend Developer building things for the web3 with Blockchain Community all around the world.

As a Blockchain Developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between Blockchain and Design - Combine my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create an Awesome Blockchain Product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging pixel-perfect user experiences.

<b>When I'm not in front of a computer screen,</b> I'm probably having fun, Blockchain trading contests, Hackthathon, or crossing off another item on a bucket list.
