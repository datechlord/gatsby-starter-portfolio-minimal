I'm a Blockchain and Frontend Developer Building things for the web with some awesome people all around the world. 

As a Blockchain Developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between Blockchain and Design - Combine my techincal knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a Awesome Blockchain Product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging pixel-perfect user experiences.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably having fun, online trading contest, gaming or crossing off another item on bucket list.
